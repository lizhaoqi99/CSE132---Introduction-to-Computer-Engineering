Projects for CSE 132 Introduction to Computer Engineering.

Course description:

This course introduces students to fundamental concepts in the basic operation of computers, ranging from desktops and servers to microcontrollers and handheld devices. Subjects include digital and analog input/output, sensing the physical world, information representation, basic computer architecture and machine language, time-critical computation, machine-to-machine communication and protocol design. Students will use both desktop systems and handheld microcontrollers for laboratory experiments. Active-learning sessions are conducted in a studio setting in which students interact with each other and the professor to solve problems collaboratively.
